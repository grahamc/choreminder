# What & How

Choreminder is an Arduino-based task reminder. Each task is intended to be
completed within roughly 20 minutes. Here's what I do every day:

- Wipe down the tables, counters, and the shower each night
- Clean all the dishes and put them all away
- Sweep the entire house
- One task from Choreminder

Check out this article which inspired it all: http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-keep-your-kitchen-clean-in-20-minutes-a-day-for-30-days-164563

Note: This article is specific to your kitchen, but I find it applies well to
the remainder of the house as well.
